## Installation
First make a python virtual environment:
```sh
python -m venv env
```

Then activate the virtual environment:
```sh
For Windows,
  ./env/Scripts/Activate.ps1 # for powershell
  ./env/Scripts/activate.bat # for Command Prompt
For POSIX,
  source env/Scripts/Activate
```

Install necessary packages with:
```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a .env file with your bot's token.
```
Token = <your_bot_token_here>
```

Now you can run the project.
```sh
python main.py
```
<br>

`Note:` 
<br> 
>This bot was hosted for free in the cloud computing platform called <b>repl.it</b>. So, you may notice the usage of replit's database at some point.

<br>

`To use replit:`
<br>
>Make an account, create a new project and import your fork of this github repository there. Initialize the db and .env file there and you are set.
